# TinyML course
 Code written while learning TinyML using [this book](https://tinymlbook.com/). Example code from the book can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/tree/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples).

## Setup
To run TensorFlow you need Linux OS. I recommend using Ubuntu or Debian. If you don't have Linux PC you can use WSL to install Ubuntu on Windows. You should also be able to use Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS.

### Install required tools
``` bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git
```
