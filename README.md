# TinyML course
 Code written while learning TinyML using [this book](https://tinymlbook.com/). Example code from the book can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/tree/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples).

## Setup
To run TensorFlow you need Linux OS. I recommend using Ubuntu or Debian. If you don't have a Linux PC you can install Ubuntu on Windows using WSL - just go to the Microsoft Store and search for Ubuntu. You should also be able to use Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS, but I haven't tested that.

### Install required tools
``` bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git
```
